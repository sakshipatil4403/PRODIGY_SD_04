# Sudoku Solver

Sudoku Solver is a Python program that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and finds the correct arrangement of numbers to solve the puzzle.

## How It Works

The program uses a backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions. It starts by filling in the missing numbers with candidate values and checks if they are valid. If a candidate value is valid for a cell, it proceeds to the next empty cell. If no candidate value is valid, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different value. This process continues until a solution is found or it determines that no solution exists.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the Python script.
   
   ```shell
   python sudoku_solver.py
